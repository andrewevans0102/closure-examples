# React Closures

This project is a companion to my upcoming post on LogRocket about [JavaScript Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) that happen in React. The project was built with vite and can be ran locally with:

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
```

The project demonstrates JavaScript closures in React. There are 2 examples and their solutions:

-   A `setTimeout` example in `SetTimeoutIssue.tsx` and `SetTimeoutSolution.tsx`
-   A mocked example of [Azure's SignalR JavaScript Client](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/javascript-client?view=aspnetcore-9.0&tabs=visual-studio) with `SignalRIssue.tsx` and `SignalRSolution.tsx`
